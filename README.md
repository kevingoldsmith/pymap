I was reading [Nathan Yau's book "Visualize This"](https://www.amazon.com/Visualize-This-FlowingData-Visualization-Statistics/dp/0470944889).
I came across the chapter where he was using SVG files loaded from wikimedia and then using python to colorize them. I decided to try it out.
These are the code samples from the book updated to Python 3.7 and fixed (there were some errors in the code in the book).
